<h1>Childhood Immunization Analysis</h1>

## Project Overview:

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis on 2017 CDC data about childhood immunizations. The goal was to uncover key insights regarding immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness, and correlations between various factors.

## Key Achievements:

Education Level Analysis: Investigated the relationship between a mother's education level and the likelihood of her child being vaccinated. Results were presented as proportions for each education level.

Breastfeeding and Influenza Vaccination: Explored the connection between children who were breastfed and the average number of seasonal influenza vaccines they received.

Chickenpox Vaccine Effectiveness: Analyzed data to determine any evidence of a correlation between a child's gender and the effectiveness of the chickenpox vaccine. Additionally, identified a statistical relationship between having contracted chickenpox and the number of varicella vaccine doses received.

Statistical Analysis: Utilized Pearson correlation to uncover the statistical significance and strength of relationships in the dataset.

Tools & Technologies: Python, pandas, scipy.stats

## Conclusion:

This project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence childhood vaccination. The data-driven results can aid healthcare policymakers in making informed decisions to improve immunization rates and overall public health.
